# ðŸ’« About Me:
My name is Awointa. I am a developer proficient in JavaScript and TypeScript, specializing in building web applications with React.js. My curiosity has also led me to explore backend development with Express.js. Currently, I am expanding my skillset by learning Cairo to develop and implement new ideas block by block.
